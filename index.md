### [](#header-3) [Course2Vec: Course Embeddings are Incredibly Useful](https://vjtrost88.github.io/trost-Course2Vec Course Embeddings are Incredibly Useful-Poster.pdf)  

I worked with my boss Drew Wham's course embeddings in Gensim to run interesting machine learning tasks on the learned embeddings. Being at PSU in the Teaching and Learning with Technology Department, we have access to a plethora of student data, and one of those datasets is a complete record of the sequence of courses every student has taken at Penn State. We can embed these courses using the context around the order in which students take them. Think of the courses as words, the sequences per semester as sentences, and the overall sequence for a student as a document. Given hundreds of thousands of these overall sequences, we can come up with numeric representations of courses that allow us to capture very subtle relationships between them. With this capability, we can come up with a recommendation system for students to take courses when scheduling their next semester.
